# hugo-app-template

This repository provides a Cookiecutter template for a simple, empty hugo site.

It's not particularly interesting. I use this template to create static websites
which are deployed to my own infrastructure. They are highly specific to my use case.

## Usage

```
$ python -m venv venv
$ source venv/bin/activate
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
$ cookiecutter template
```
